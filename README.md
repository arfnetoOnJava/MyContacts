Code for Section 13 Lesson 205 changed to run on jdk11, windows 64

this is just the code provide by tim on 
JavaFX-JavaFX-Challenge-Wrap-up-Source-code.zip, no changes

I just added stuff to run the code under windows 64 and jdk11 and is here as an example

I am not publishing the code from the instructor. This is just for my use and is here in a way it can help other students

These changes are something I believe the instructor should have done himself already, since the "final" code as provided only runs on JDK8 and many of us does not have this particular JDK.

And the knowledge to change everything to make it run was NOT discussed properly over this or the previous lessons. Since the provided code "as is" just crashes under JDK11 this leads to a very frustating situation.

Changes were made by trial and error since the previous lectures and the final magic line 
"open sample.datamodel to javafx.base" in module-info.java was provided by the instructor Goran
